# Hand-sewn Endbands

Most commercial hardcovers usually have a decorative piece of fabric glued to the top and bottom of the spine. These are "stuck-on" endbands, and they are purely cosmetic. A *hand-sewn* endband, however, is a structural component that reinforces the head and tail of the book against the strain of being pulled off a shelf.

### The Structure

A sewn endband consists of:
1.  **The Core:** A round cord (leather, vellum, or cord) that sits on the top edge of the text block.
2.  **The Sewing:** Silk or linen thread that wraps around the core and is tied down into the signatures of the book.

### Why Sew Them?
*   **Strength:** The tie-downs anchor the endband into the book block, helping to maintain the spine's shape (the "arch").
*   **Protection:** The core protects the vulnerable edges of the spine from crushing.
*   **Beauty:** The intricate weaving of colored threads is a hallmark of fine binding.

### Materials
*   **Thread:** Silk buttonhole twist is traditional for its sheen, but embroidery floss works for beginners.
*   **Core:** 1mm - 2mm round leather cord or stiff hemp cord.
*   **Needle:** A small, sharp embroidery needle.

### Basic Technique: Two-Color Pattern

1.  **Anchor:** Start in the center of the first signature. Bring the thread out through the spine fold, just below the kettle stitch.
2.  **Wrap:** Position the core on the text block edge. Wrap the thread over the core.
3.  **Tie-Down:** Every few wraps (or every signature), the needle goes back into the book spine (a few millimeters down) and comes out the back of the spine to anchor the loop.
4.  **Bead:** A proper endband has a "bead"—a small knot formed at the base of the core on the front. This is created by the way the threads cross.

### Common Styles
*   **Single Core:** The standard round band.
*   **Double Core:** A smaller core sits in front of a larger one (typical in French bindings).
*   **Flat Coptic:** Sewn into the covers of Coptic bindings, often extending across the spine.

Practicing endbands is excellent training for tension control and fine needlework.
