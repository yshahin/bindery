Sharp tools are essential for quality bookbinding, especially when working with leather. A dull knife tears rather than cuts, makes paring impossible, and creates frustration. This workshop covers sharpening principles and techniques for the knives bookbinders use most.

### Why Sharpness Matters

In bookbinding, sharpness affects:

**Leather paring:** A dull knife skips and gouges
**Paper cutting:** Dull blades tear fibers
**Board cutting:** Dull knives require excessive force
**Safety:** Dull knives require more pressure, increasing slip risk
**Results:** Clean cuts vs. ragged edges

### Understanding Knife Edges

Before sharpening, understand what you're creating:

#### The Bevel

The bevel is the angled surface leading to the cutting edge.

```
Cross-section:
      ╱│
     ╱ │
    ╱  │  ← Bevel angle
   ╱   │
  ╱────│
  Edge
```

**Bevel angle considerations:**
- Lower angle = sharper but more fragile
- Higher angle = more durable but less sharp
- Paring knives: 15-20 degrees
- General cutting: 20-25 degrees

#### Single vs. Double Bevel

**Single bevel (chisel grind):**
- One flat side, one beveled side
- Traditional for Japanese tools and some paring knives
- Excels for specific cuts

**Double bevel:**
- Both sides beveled equally
- Most Western knives
- More versatile

### Tools for Sharpening

#### Sharpening Stones

**Water stones:**
- Japanese style, require soaking
- Cut fast, various grits available
- Need flattening regularly
- Excellent for fine edges

**Oil stones:**
- Western tradition
- Use with honing oil
- More durable surface
- Slower cutting

**Diamond stones:**
- Fast cutting
- Stay flat
- Various grits
- Good for heavy work

**Ceramic stones:**
- Very fine finishing
- No lubricant needed
- For final polishing

#### Grits Explained

| Grit Range | Purpose | When to Use |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 200-400 | Coarse | Reshaping damaged edges |
| 800-1000 | Medium | Regular sharpening |
| 3000-5000 | Fine | Honing and refining |
| 6000-8000 | Very fine | Polishing for razors |

For bookbinding, a medium (1000) and fine (4000-6000) stone combination serves most needs.

### Sharpening Technique

#### Basic Motion

The fundamental sharpening motion:

1. Place blade on stone at correct angle
2. Maintain consistent angle throughout stroke
3. Push edge-first (or pull, depending on tradition)
4. Use full stone length
5. Apply even pressure
6. Count strokes for consistency

#### Maintaining Angle

The most common sharpening challenge:

**Techniques:**
- Use angle guide (commercial or DIY)
- Mark blade with marker - sharpening removes mark at correct angle
- Practice with consistent hand position
- Feel for the angle where bevel meets stone flat

#### The Burr

When sharpening creates a burr (wire edge):
- Tiny fold of metal forms at edge
- Indicates you've reached the edge
- Must be removed for clean cutting

**Removing the burr:**
1. Flip blade and take light strokes on opposite side
2. Alternate sides with decreasing pressure
3. Strop to remove final burr

### Sharpening Specific Tools

#### Paring Knives

Paring knives require exceptional sharpness.

**French paring knife:**
- Curved blade
- Single bevel on working side
- Sharpen convex curve on stone
- Rock blade to follow curve

**English paring knife:**
- Straight blade
- Often double bevel
- Standard flat stone technique
- Very fine finishing required

**Sharpening process:**
1. Start at 1000 grit
2. Work edge until burr forms
3. Progress to 4000 grit
4. Final polish at 6000-8000 if available
5. Strop for final refinement

#### Craft Knives and Scalpels

For disposable-blade knives:
- Replace blades rather than sharpening
- Fresh blade always sharper than resharpened
- Economical given blade cost

For fixed-blade craft knives:
- Similar to paring knife technique
- Shorter strokes for smaller blades
- Maintain factory angle

#### Scissors

Bookbinding scissors need occasional attention:

**When to sharpen:**
- Blades fold paper instead of cutting
- Require squeezing hard
- Visible nicks or damage

**Technique:**
1. Work on outside bevel only
2. Maintain original angle
3. Light strokes, burr forms on inside
4. Never sharpen flat inside surface
5. Test cut frequently

### Stropping

A strop polishes and aligns the edge after sharpening.

#### Strop Types

**Leather strop:**
- Traditionally on wood paddle
- May use compound (chromium oxide, etc.)
- Traditional barber-style stropping

**Cardboard strop:**
- Cardboard loaded with compound
- Very fine abrasive
- Excellent for maintenance

**Bare leather:**
- Aligns edge without removing metal
- Final polish
- Quick touch-up between sharpenings

#### Stropping Technique

1. Lay blade flat on strop
2. Edge trailing (opposite of stone sharpening)
3. Light pressure only
4. Full length strokes
5. 10-20 strokes per side

**Critical:** Edge trails during stropping. Edge leading will cut the strop.

### Maintenance Schedule

#### Daily

- Strop before starting work
- Wipe blades clean after use
- Check for damage

#### Weekly/As Needed

- Touch up on fine stone
- Strop thoroughly
- Clean stones

#### Monthly/As Needed

- Full sharpening progression
- Check for chips requiring coarse stone
- Clean and condition handles

### Testing Sharpness

Several methods to evaluate your edge:

**Paper test:**
- Hold paper vertically
- Slice downward
- Sharp knife cuts cleanly
- Dull knife tears or catches

**Hair test:**
- Push edge against arm hair
- Sharp blade shaves hair
- Paring knife standard

**Visual inspection:**
- Light catches dull spots
- Sharp edge is invisible
- Rounded edge reflects light

**Thumbnail test:**
- Edge catches on nail
- Gently, don't cut yourself
- Dull blade slides off

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Can't get sharp | Angle inconsistent | Use guide, practice angle |
| Edge chips easily | Angle too low | Increase bevel angle |
| Knife still dull after sharpening | Not reaching the edge | Check for burr formation |
| Uneven edge | Pressure not distributed | Full stone contact, even pressure |
| Stone glazing | Metal buildup | Flatten and clean stone |

### Stone Maintenance

Sharpening stones need care too.

#### Flattening Water Stones

Water stones dish (become concave) with use:
1. Use flattening stone or plate
2. Draw grid on stone with pencil
3. Work in figure-8 pattern
4. Continue until all grid lines removed

#### Cleaning

- Remove metal particles regularly
- Rinse water stones thoroughly
- Oil stones: wipe clean, replenish oil
- Diamond stones: scrub with soap and water

### Safety Considerations

Working with sharp tools requires care:

**During sharpening:**
- Secure stones (use non-slip mat)
- Keep fingers behind edge
- Focus on the task
- Good lighting essential

**During use:**
- Cut away from yourself when possible
- Keep work secure
- Don't rush
- Respect the edge

### Building the Kit

**Beginner sharpening kit:**
- 1000 grit water stone
- 4000 grit water stone
- Leather strop with compound
- Stone flattening plate
- Non-slip mat

**Cost-effective alternatives:**
- Wet/dry sandpaper on glass plate (various grits)
- Cardboard strop with compound
- Marker for angle checking

### Conclusion

Sharpening is a skill that develops with practice. The investment in learning proper technique pays dividends in every cut you make. Sharp tools are safer, produce better results, and make work enjoyable rather than frustrating.

Start with your most-used knife. Practice the motion until it becomes natural. Maintain your edges regularly, and you'll always be ready for precise, clean work.
