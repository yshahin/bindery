Thread choice affects both the strength and appearance of your binding. Each thread type has distinct properties that make it suitable for specific applications. This guide helps you choose wisely for every project.

### Thread Properties That Matter

When selecting thread, consider:

**Strength:** Must withstand sewing tension and long-term stress
**Smoothness:** Affects how easily it passes through holes
**Elasticity:** Some give helps absorb stress; too much causes loosening
**Appearance:** Visible in exposed spine bindings
**Longevity:** Must outlast the book it binds

### Linen Thread

The traditional bookbinding thread of choice.

- Matte appearance
- Excellent durability

#### Available Forms

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Unpolished | Natural finish, slight fuzz | General bookwork |
| Polished | Smooth, slight sheen | Fine binding |
| Waxed | Pre-waxed for ease | Ready to use |
| Unwaxed | Raw, requires waxing | Custom preparation |

#### When to Use Linen

**Ideal for:**
- Traditional bindings

| Cost | High | Highest | Low | Moderate |
| Availability | Specialty | Specialty | Wide | Wide |

### Thread Weight and Sizing

Thread thickness must match paper and project:

#### Measuring Thread

**Cord count:** Number of plies twisted together (3-cord, 6-cord, etc.)
**Pound rating:** Traditional system (higher = thinner)
**Metric:** Tex or denier measurements

#### Matching Thread to Project

| Project Type | Paper Weight | Recommended Thread |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Pamphlets | Light | Fine/thin thread |
| Journals | Medium | Medium weight |
| Heavy books | Heavy | Thick/strong thread |
| Coptic | Visible | Medium, appearance matters |
| Stab binding | Decorative | Heavier, visible |

**General rule:** Thread should not be thicker than the paper can comfortably accommodate without tearing.

### Waxing Thread

Wax treatment improves thread performance.

#### Why Wax Thread

- Reduces tangling
- Strengthens the thread
- Eases passage through holes
- Adds slight stiffness for control
- Helps thread grip in knots

#### How to Wax

1. Obtain beeswax block
2. Hold thread taut
3. Draw thread across wax
4. Repeat 2-3 times
5. Pull through fingers to distribute and remove excess

#### Wax Options

**Beeswax:** Traditional, slightly sticky
**Microcrystalline wax:** More refined, less sticky
**Pre-waxed thread:** Convenient, consistent
