The French link stitch combines the decorative appeal of Coptic-style exposed sewing with the structural benefits of sewing onto tapes. Thread links between signatures create a chain pattern on the spine while tape supports provide added strength for the binding.

### Understanding French Link Stitch

French link stitch differs from both simple link stitch and tape sewing:

**Combines:**
- Visible chain stitch pattern (like Coptic)
- Tape supports at sewing stations
- Strong structural connection
- Decorative exposed spine

**Results in:**
- Books that open well
- Strong, durable structure
- Beautiful spine appearance
- Appropriate for medium to heavy books

### When to Use French Link

**Ideal for:**
- Sketchbooks and journals (needs durability)
- Books receiving heavy use
- Medium to thick text blocks
- When both strength and beauty matter

**Compare to other stitches:**
| Stitch Type | Strength | Decoration | Complexity |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Kettle stitch | Good | Hidden | Basic |
| Link stitch | Good | Visible | Intermediate |
| French link | Excellent | Visible | Intermediate |
| Coptic | Good | Very visible | Intermediate |

### Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Text paper | Folded signatures | Standard preparation |
| Cover boards | Book board | If making a case |
| Tapes | Linen or cotton, 1/2" wide | 2-4 depending on book size |
| Thread | Waxed linen | Medium weight |
| Needle | Curved or straight | Large eye |
| Awl | For piercing | Sharp |
| Sewing frame (optional) | For tape positioning | Helpful but not essential |

### Preparing the Tapes

#### Tape Selection

**Linen tape:** Traditional, strong
**Cotton tape:** More economical, good grip
**Width:** 1/2" to 3/4" typical

#### Tape Quantity

Based on spine height:
- Small books (under 6"): 2 tapes
- Medium books (6-9"): 3 tapes
- Large books (over 9"): 4+ tapes

#### Tape Preparation

1. Cut tapes to approximately 3" longer than spine width
2. Tapes will extend beyond the text block
3. Extensions later attach to boards or fold inside

### Marking and Piercing

#### Station Layout

Example for 3 tapes on 8" spine:

```
Head end → ────────────────── ← Kettle station (1/2" from edge)

          ═══════════════════ ← Tape 1 (2" from head)

          ═══════════════════ ← Tape 2 (4" - center)

          ═══════════════════ ← Tape 3 (6" from head)

Tail end → ────────────────── ← Kettle station (1/2" from edge)
```

**At each tape:** Pierce holes on either side (thread enters one side, exits other)

#### Piercing Pattern

For each signature at each tape station:
- Two holes, straddling the tape position
- Holes approximately 3/8" apart
- Tape will sit between these holes

**Total holes per signature (for 3 tapes):**
- 2 kettle stations (head and tail)
- 6 tape stations (2 per tape)
- Total: 8 holes

### The French Link Sewing Pattern

#### Setting Up

1. Position first signature
2. Place tapes across spine at marked positions
3. Tapes sit behind the signature
4. Hold tapes in place (sewing frame, tape, or assistant)

#### Sewing Signature 1

1. Enter at head kettle station from inside
2. Exit outside, wrap thread around tape 1
3. Re-enter signature on other side of tape
4. Sew inside to tape 2
5. Exit, wrap around tape 2, re-enter
6. Continue to tape 3
7. Exit, wrap around tape 3, re-enter
8. Exit at tail kettle station
9. Leave thread tail for tying

**Pattern:** The thread wraps around each tape, creating the structural connection.

#### Adding Signature 2

1. Position signature 2 on top of signature 1
2. Enter at tail from outside
3. At tape 3: exit, link to signature 1 (the French link), re-enter
4. Continue through signature
5. At each tape: exit, link to previous signature, re-enter
6. At head: kettle stitch to signature 1
7. Tie to starting tail with square knot

#### The French Link (The Key Technique)

The "French link" happens at each tape:

1. Thread exits signature at tape station
2. Pass needle behind the tape
3. Loop around the thread from previous signature (creating link)
4. Pass behind tape again
5. Re-enter signature on other side of tape

This creates the chain pattern visible on the spine.

**Visual:**
```
     Sig 2 thread
         │
         │ ╭──○──╮  ← Link loop
    ═════╪═══════╪═════ ← Tape
         │       │
         │ ╰──●──╯  ← Thread from Sig 1
         │
```

#### Continuing the Pattern

For each subsequent signature:
1. Enter at the end where previous exited
2. At each tape: French link to previous signature
3. Kettle stitch at spine ends
4. Build up chain pattern at tapes

### Board Attachment Options

The tape extensions allow several attachment methods:

#### Laced-In Boards

Traditional method:
1. Cut slots in boards for tapes
2. Thread tapes through slots
3. Fray and paste down tape ends
4. Cover with pastedown

Strong, historical, clean appearance.

#### Adhered Tapes

Simpler method:
1. Paste tape extensions to inside of boards
2. Cover with pastedown
3. Functional but less refined

#### Exposed Tapes

Contemporary option:
1. Leave tapes visible
2. Creates design feature
3. Industrial or artistic aesthetic

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Links uneven | Inconsistent technique | Practice, develop rhythm |
| Tapes shifting | Not secured well | Better initial attachment |
| Tension inconsistent | Variable pulling | Focus on even tension |
| Forgetting links | Complex pattern | Count stations systematically |
| Holes tearing | Too close to edge | Increase margins |

### Tips for Success

**Tape Management:**
- Secure tapes well before starting
- A sewing frame makes this easier
- Or use small pieces of tape to hold in place

**Thread Tension:**
- Snug but not tight
- Tapes should stay centered
- Links should lie flat

**Rhythm:**
- Develop a consistent motion
- Count stations to avoid missing links
- Take time with first few signatures

### Variations

#### Single Link

Simplified version:
- Link only to adjacent signature (not through previous chain)
- Easier but less decorative

#### Colored Thread

Design element:
- Contrasting thread highlights the chain
- Multiple colors possible
- Decorative emphasis

#### Combined with Other Structures

French link can combine with:
- Exposed spine covers
- Limp bindings
- Case bindings (tapes hidden inside)

### Practice Exercise

**Practice book:**
- 5 signatures, 3 sheets each
- 2 tapes
- Scrap paper fine
- Focus on link formation

**Goals:**
- Consistent links
- Even tension
- Understand the pattern

### Conclusion

French link stitch offers an excellent balance of structural strength and visual appeal. The tapes provide support while the linked thread creates an attractive chain pattern.

Master the basic rhythm of exit-link-reenter at each tape, and the technique becomes natural. The result is a binding that works as well as it looks, suitable for books that will see real use while displaying your craftsmanship.
