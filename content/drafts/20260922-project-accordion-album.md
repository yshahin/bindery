The accordion book (also called concertina, leporello, or orihon) is one of the oldest and most versatile book structures. Originating in Asia, this format unfolds to display a continuous surface while also functioning as a traditional page-turning book. This project creates a photo album using the accordion format.

### Project Overview

**Structure:** Accordion fold with hard covers
**Finished size:** 6" x 6" (square format, ideal for photos)
**Pages:** 12 panels (can hold 24 photos if mounted both sides)
**Time required:** 2-3 hours
**Skill level:** Beginner

### Understanding Accordion Structure

The accordion book consists of:
- One continuous strip of paper, folded in alternating directions
- Hard covers attached at each end
- Pages that can be viewed individually or as continuous panorama

### Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Quantity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Heavy paper | 100-140 lb, grain short | Strip 6" x 72" (or joined pieces) |
| Binder's board | 2mm | 2 pieces, 6.25" x 6.25" |
| Book cloth | Enough to cover | Approximately 8" x 16" |

| PVA glue | As needed | - |
| Bone folder | - | For crisp folds |
| Ruler and pencil | - | For measuring |

### Understanding Paper Requirements

#### Grain Direction

**Critical:** Grain must run parallel to the folds (perpendicular to the strip length).

**Why:** Cross-grain folds fight the paper and create inferior results.

#### Joining Paper Strips

Most paper doesn't come in 72" lengths:

**Joining method:**
1. Cut strips to 6" wide
2. Overlap ends by 1/2"
3. Apply thin layer of paste
4. Press until dry
5. Creates continuous strip

**Hide the joins:**
- Position joins inside a fold
- They become invisible when folded
- Plan join positions before gluing

### Step-by-Step Construction

#### Step 1: Prepare the Accordion Strip

**If using single sheet:**
1. Cut to 6" x 72"
2. Verify grain runs across the 6" dimension

**If joining strips:**
1. Cut multiple strips 6" wide
2. Join to achieve total length
3. Allow joins to dry completely

#### Step 2: Mark and Score Folds

For 12 equal panels:
1. Total length divided by 12 = panel width
2. 72" ÷ 12 = 6" panels (creates square format)
3. Mark fold lines at every 6"
4. Score each fold line with bone folder
5. Verify all marks are straight and parallel

**Precision matters:** Small errors compound across multiple folds.

#### Step 3: Fold the Accordion

1. Begin at one end
2. Fold first score away from you (mountain fold)
3. Move to next score
4. Fold toward you (valley fold)
5. Alternate: mountain, valley, mountain, valley...
6. Continue through all folds

**Technique:**
- Fold each crease sharply with bone folder
- Verify alignment at each fold
- Stack should become neat brick shape

#### Step 4: Press the Accordion

1. Stack all folds aligned
2. Place between pressing boards
3. Weight overnight
4. This sets creases permanently

### Creating the Covers

#### Step 5: Cut the Boards

1. Cut two pieces of binder's board
2. Size: 6.25" x 6.25" (slightly larger than accordion)
3. Check both are identical
4. Sand any rough edges

#### Step 6: Cover the Boards

For each cover:
1. Cut book cloth 1" larger than board on all sides
2. Apply PVA evenly to board
3. Center board on cloth
4. Turn corners (miter cut for neatness)
5. Turn in edges, bone folder sharp
6. Press flat

**Details:**
- Work quickly before glue sets
- Press out air bubbles
- Clean edges

### Attaching Accordion to Covers

#### Step 7: Prepare Endpapers

The decorative paper covers the inside of each cover and attaches the accordion.

1. Cut two pieces of decorative paper
2. Size: 5.75" x 5.75" (slightly smaller than boards)

#### Step 8: Attach First End

1. Place front cover face down
2. Apply PVA to first accordion panel
3. Position accordion centered on cover
4. Press firmly
5. Apply PVA to endpaper
6. Position over accordion attachment
7. Covers the joint and decorates interior
8. Press and weight

**Alignment:**
- Equal margins on all sides
- Accordion should be centered
- Endpaper should be centered within cover

#### Step 9: Attach Second End

1. Fold accordion to stack
2. Verify last panel is correctly oriented
3. Attach to back cover using same method
4. Be careful not to twist the accordion

### Finishing

#### Step 10: Final Pressing

1. With accordion collapsed, press entire book
2. Weight overnight
3. This sets all attachments

#### Step 11: Check Your Work

- [ ] All folds crisp and even
- [ ] Covers attached squarely
- [ ] Accordion opens smoothly
- [ ] Accordion closes completely flat
- [ ] No adhesive showing

### Mounting Photos

#### Mounting Options

**Adhesive mounting:**
- Photo corners (archival, removable)
- Spray adhesive (permanent)
- Photo tape (clean but permanent)
- PVA (permanent, may ripple photos)

**Sleeve mounting:**
- Create paper sleeves for each panel
- Photos slide in and out
- Easiest to change

#### Photo Arrangement

**Single-sided:**
- One photo per panel
- 12 photos total
- View like traditional album

**Double-sided:**
- Photos on both sides
- 24 photos total
- Must view panels individually

**Continuous panorama:**
- Extended photo strip
- Unfolds to show complete image
- Creative display option

### Design Variations

#### Extended Accordion

More panels:
- Longer strip, more folds
- Consider storage (very long accordions awkward)
- Great for visual narratives

#### Multiple Strips

Several accordions in one cover:
- Attach multiple accordion strips
- Creates layered effect
- Complex but dramatic

#### Varied Panel Sizes

Different width panels:
- Creates rhythm and variety
- Requires careful planning
- Contemporary design approach

#### Pop-Up Elements

Add dimensional pieces:
- Folds create natural pop-up opportunities
- Photos can stand at angles
- Interactive and engaging

### Display Options

Accordion books offer unique display:

**Extended on shelf:**
- Unfold partially or fully
- Freestanding when zigzagged
- Dynamic display

**In box or case:**
- Protect when not displayed
- Presentation quality
- Gift-worthy

**Framed extended:**
- Full panorama visible
- Under glass for protection
- Art object rather than book

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Accordion won't fold flat | Uneven fold widths | More precise measuring |
| Twisted accordion | Panels not aligned | Realign before final pressing |
| Cover won't close | Accordion attached crooked | Reattach carefully |
| Folds not crisp | Insufficient scoring/pressing | More bone folder work, longer pressing |
| Photos rippling | Too much adhesive | Use corners or lighter adhesive |

### Historical Context

Accordion books have ancient origins:

**Asian tradition:**
- Chinese origin (possibly Tang Dynasty)
- Called orihon in Japan
- Used for sutras and calligraphy
- Continuous scroll heritage

**Western adoption:**
- European leporello (named for Don Giovanni's servant)
- Used for panoramic views
- Popular in 19th century for travel scenes

### Conclusion

The accordion album combines practical photo storage with versatile display options. Its simple structure belies sophisticated possibilities for visual storytelling.

Start with this basic project, then explore variations. The accordion format adapts to many purposes beyond photos: sketchbooks, travel journals, artist's books, and presentation pieces all work beautifully in this ancient yet endlessly adaptable form.
