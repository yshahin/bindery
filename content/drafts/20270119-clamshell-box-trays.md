The clamshell box (or Solander box) provides the highest level of protection for books, documents, and art. Named after Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander who commissioned the design in the 18th century, this enclosure has two trays that nest together. Part 1 covers constructing the trays - the foundation of this sophisticated box.

### Understanding Clamshell Construction

A clamshell box consists of:
- **Base tray:** Holds the book, slightly smaller
- **Lid tray:** Covers the base, slightly larger
- **Case:** Wraps around the nested trays, connecting them at the spine

```
Assembled view:
      ┌─────────────┐
      │    Lid      │

      │  │ Base  │  │
      │  │ (book)│  │
      │  └───────┘  │
      └─────────────┘
```

The trays nest together, with the lid dropping over the base.

### Project Overview

**Structure:** Two-tray clamshell (Solander box)
**Size:** Custom to your book (this tutorial uses 6" x 8" x 1" book)
**Time required:** 4-6 hours over two sessions
**Skill level:** Intermediate to Advanced

This article covers tray construction. Part 2 covers casing.

### Measuring for the Trays

Precision is critical. Measure your book carefully.

#### Book Measurements

| Dimension | Where to Measure | Add for Base | Add for Lid |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Height | Head to tail | +3mm | +6mm |
| Width | Spine to fore edge | +3mm | +6mm |
| Thickness | Board to board | +2mm (half) | +2mm (half) + board thickness |

**Why different additions:**
- Base: Slight ease for book to fit
- Lid: Must fit over base plus cover material thickness

#### Our Example Book

Book: 6" x 8" x 1"

**Base tray interior:**
- Height: 6" + 3mm = approximately 6 1/8"
- Width: 8" + 3mm = approximately 8 1/8"
- Depth: 1/2" + 2mm = approximately 9/16"

**Lid tray interior:**
- Height: Base height + 6mm = approximately 6 3/8"
- Width: Base width + 6mm = approximately 8 3/8"
- Depth: Similar, plus one board thickness

### Materials Needed

| Material | Specification | Quantity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Binder's board | 2mm | For all tray walls |
| Covering material | Book cloth or paper | Enough for exterior |
| Lining paper | Acid-free | For interiors |
| PVA glue | Bookbinding quality | As needed |
| Bone folder | Standard | For corners |
| Ruler and knife | Metal ruler, sharp blade | For cutting |

### Understanding Tray Construction

Each tray has:
- **Floor:** Bottom board
- **Walls:** Four side pieces
- **Covering:** Wrapped exterior
- **Lining:** Interior finish

Walls attach to the floor, then everything is covered as a unit.

### Cutting the Components

#### Board Cutting List (Base Tray)

| Piece | Dimension | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Floor | Interior width x interior height | The base |
| Long walls (2) | Floor length x wall height | Along the length |
| Short walls (2) | Floor width + (2 x board thickness) x wall height | Cover floor edges |

**Note:** Short walls overlap long walls and floor edges.

#### Board Cutting List (Lid Tray)

Same principle, larger dimensions:
- All pieces sized for lid dimensions
- Follows same construction logic

<!-- TODO: Add diagram showing how walls overlap -->

### Constructing the Base Tray

#### Step 1: Cut All Boards

1. Cut floor to calculated dimensions
2. Cut two long walls
3. Cut two short walls (include board thickness overlap)
4. Verify all pieces square
5. Label pieces (LW1, LW2, SW1, SW2, Floor)

#### Step 2: Attach Long Walls

1. Apply PVA to bottom edge of first long wall
2. Position along floor's long edge
3. Wall sits ON the floor, not beside it
4. Hold until initial grab
5. Repeat with second long wall
6. Allow 15 minutes before proceeding

#### Step 3: Attach Short Walls

1. Apply PVA to bottom edge AND end edges of short wall
2. Position at floor's short edge
3. Wall overlaps floor AND long wall edges
4. Creates solid corner joints
5. Repeat with second short wall
6. Allow to dry completely (1 hour minimum)

#### Step 4: Check Square

1. Measure diagonals - should be equal
2. Verify all corners are 90 degrees
3. Minor adjustment possible while glue soft
4. If significantly off, may need to rebuild

### Covering the Tray

The exterior gets covered with cloth or paper.

#### Cutting Covering Material

Measurements:
- Width: Tray width + tray height + turn-ins (2 x 20mm)
- Length: Tray length + (2 x tray height) + turn-ins (2 x 20mm)

This allows wrap-around coverage plus turn-ins.

#### Covering Process

1. **Mark center lines** on back of covering material
2. **Apply PVA** to tray floor exterior
3. **Position tray** centered on material
4. **Press and smooth** floor attachment

##### Covering Long Walls

1. Apply PVA to one long wall exterior
2. Fold covering material up and onto wall
3. Smooth firmly
4. Repeat for opposite long wall

##### Turn-Ins at Long Walls

1. Apply PVA to turn-in area
2. Fold over wall top into interior
3. Smooth with bone folder
4. Creates finished top edge

##### Covering Short Walls

1. Cut relief at corners (miter the covering)
2. Apply PVA to short wall
3. Fold covering onto wall
4. Turn in at top
5. Repeat for second short wall

##### Corner Finishing

The corners require careful folding:
1. Fold covering into corner
2. May need small cuts for neat fold
3. Press firmly for clean appearance
4. This takes practice

<!-- TODO: Add detailed photos of corner covering -->

### Lining the Tray

Interior lining provides finished appearance:

#### Cutting Linings

Each interior surface needs lining:
- Floor: Cut 2mm smaller than floor
- Walls: Cut 2mm shorter and narrower than each wall

#### Applying Linings

**Walls first:**
1. Apply paste to lining paper
2. Position on wall, centered
3. Smooth from center outward
4. Small gap at all edges is correct

**Floor last:**
1. Apply paste to floor lining
2. Position carefully
3. Should overlap wall lining edges slightly
4. Creates clean appearance

### Constructing the Lid Tray

Follow same process as base:

1. Cut boards (larger dimensions)
2. Assemble walls to floor
3. Check for square
4. Cover exterior
5. Line interior

**Critical difference:** Lid interior dimensions must allow base to fit inside easily.

### Test Fitting

Before proceeding to casing:

1. Place base tray inside lid tray
2. Should slide in smoothly
3. Not too loose (should feel stable)
4. Not too tight (should close without forcing)

**If too tight:** Sand interior walls lightly
**If too loose:** Add additional lining paper thickness

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Result | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Walls not square | Trays don't nest | Careful construction, check frequently |
| Covering too tight at corners | Puckering | Practice corner technique |
| Linings too large | Bubbling, buckling | Cut 2mm smaller consistently |
| Wrong wall overlap | Weak corners | Follow construction sequence |
| Insufficient drying time | Parts shift | Patience between steps |

### Quality Check

Before Part 2 (casing):

- [ ] Both trays square
- [ ] Trays nest smoothly
- [ ] Covering adhered fully
- [ ] Corners neat
- [ ] Linings flat and even
- [ ] No visible adhesive

### Conclusion

Well-constructed trays form the foundation of a quality clamshell box. The precision required at this stage determines the success of the final enclosure.

Take time with the wall attachment and corner covering - these details show in the finished box. Let adhesives dry fully before proceeding. The investment in careful construction pays off in a box that protects its contents for generations.

In Part 2, we'll assess fit and create the case that joins these trays into a complete clamshell box.
