With trays constructed in Part 1, this article completes the clamshell box. The case wraps around the nested trays, creating a hinge at the spine and a finished enclosure. Proper fit assessment and careful casing technique produce a box worthy of protecting your most valued books.

### Reviewing Part 1

You should have:
- Completed base tray (covered and lined)
- Completed lid tray (covered and lined)
- Trays that nest smoothly
- Quality construction ready for casing

### Fit Assessment

Before casing, verify the trays work together.

#### Testing the Nest

1. Place base tray inside lid tray
2. Close completely
3. Check for:
   - Smooth closure
   - No binding or catching
   - Consistent gap around edges
   - Stable when closed

#### Fit Adjustments

**If too tight:**
- Sand interior lid walls lightly
- Work gradually, test frequently
- Don't remove too much

**If too loose:**
- Add thin paper lining to lid interior
- Or accept some looseness
- Rebuilding is last resort

#### Testing with Book

1. Place book in base tray
2. Nest lid over base
3. Verify book fits with slight ease
4. Box should close completely with book inside

### Understanding the Case

The case connects the trays:

```
Case layout (flat):

┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│    Base    │ Spine │     Lid        │
│   attach   │       │    attach      │
│   area     │       │    area        │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When assembled:
- Spine creates hinge
- Base attaches to one side
- Lid attaches to other side
- Opening at one end (fore edge)

### Materials for Casing

| Material | Specification | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Book board | 2mm | For case spine stiffener |
| Case covering | Book cloth | Strong, flexible at spine |
| Lining | Optional | For interior finish |
| PVA | As needed | Primary adhesive |

### Measuring for the Case

#### Case Dimensions

**Case height:** Same as lid tray height
**Case width:** Sum of:
- Base tray width
- Lid tray width
- Spine width (lid depth + base depth + 2mm ease)
- Turn-ins (2 x 15mm)

**Spine piece dimensions:**
- Width: Lid depth + base depth + 2mm
- Height: Case height minus turn-in allowance

### Constructing the Case

#### Step 1: Cut Components

1. Cut spine stiffener board
2. Cut covering material to calculated size
3. Mark positions on covering material:
   - Spine position (center)
   - Board attachment zones (either side of spine)
   - Turn-in lines

#### Step 2: Attach Spine Stiffener

1. Apply PVA to spine stiffener
2. Position on covering material at marked location
3. Press firmly
4. This creates the structured spine

**Leave gaps** between spine stiffener and where boards will attach - this creates the flex points for opening.

#### Step 3: Create Hinge Zones

The case needs to flex at two points:
- Between spine and base attachment
- Between spine and lid attachment

**Gap width:** Approximately board thickness (2mm) + covering material thickness

These gaps allow the case to fold properly.

### Attaching Trays to Case

#### Positioning

This is the critical step:

1. Nest trays together
2. Place nested trays on case material
3. Position so:
   - Base is on base side of spine
   - Lid is on lid side of spine
   - Spine aligns with tray spines
   - Equal margins at head and tail

#### Step 4: Attach Base Tray

1. Open nested trays (keeping position marked)
2. Apply PVA to case material in base attachment zone
3. Also apply to exterior of base tray
4. Carefully position base tray on case
5. Press firmly, verify alignment
6. Allow partial dry (15 minutes)

#### Step 5: Attach Lid Tray

1. Apply PVA to case material in lid attachment zone
2. Apply to exterior of lid tray
3. Fold case over and position lid
4. Nest trays to check alignment
5. Adjust before adhesive sets
6. Press firmly

#### Step 6: Turn-Ins

Complete the case edges:

1. Apply PVA to turn-in areas
2. Fold head and tail turn-ins first
3. Wrap over tray edges and into interior
4. Then complete fore edge turn-ins
5. Work corners neatly

<!-- TODO: Add photos showing tray attachment sequence -->

### The Fore Edge

The fore edge (opening) can be treated several ways:

#### Option 1: Simple Open Edge

- Turn-ins only
- No closure mechanism
- Simplest approach
- Box stays closed by friction

#### Option 2: Ribbon Ties

1. Attach ribbons during case construction
2. Position at fore edge
3. Tie to close
4. Decorative and functional

#### Option 3: Magnetic Closures

1. Insert small magnets during construction
2. Hidden inside case structure
3. Invisible closure
4. Modern, clean appearance

### Final Assembly Steps

#### Interior Finishing

The case interior may need finishing:

1. Cut lining papers for case interior sections
2. Apply over any exposed board
3. Creates finished appearance
4. Covers attachment areas

#### Press and Cure

1. Close the clamshell gently
2. Place under weight
3. Allow 24 hours cure time
4. Check function before first use

### Quality Assessment

Evaluate the finished box:

**Function:**
- [ ] Opens and closes smoothly
- [ ] Trays nest properly
- [ ] Book fits with appropriate ease
- [ ] Spine flexes at correct points

**Appearance:**
- [ ] Covering smooth, no bubbles
- [ ] Corners neat
- [ ] Turn-ins even
- [ ] Overall professional appearance

**Durability:**
- [ ] All attachments secure
- [ ] No loose areas
- [ ] Joints strong

### Troubleshooting Final Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Won't close flat | Hinge gaps too small | May need to remake case |
| Trays misaligned | Positioning error | Difficult to fix post-casing |
| Covering bubbling | Air or adhesive issue | Slit and re-adhere |
| Weak attachment | Insufficient adhesive | Reinforce carefully |
| Box twists | Construction not square | Limited fixes available |

### Design Variations

#### Decorative Spines

- Apply different covering to spine
- Add title label
- Gold tooling (advanced)

#### Window Lid

- Cut window in lid before casing
- Allows viewing contents without opening
- More complex construction

#### Ribbon Pull

- Add ribbon inside base tray
- Allows easy book removal
- Functional addition

### Caring for Your Clamshell Box

**Storage:**
- Store flat or upright
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Moderate humidity

**Handling:**
- Open gently
- Support at spine when opening
- Don't overfill

### The Complete Process Review

Creating a clamshell box requires:

1. **Careful measurement** - Precision determines fit
2. **Tray construction** - Foundation of the box
3. **Fit assessment** - Verification before casing
4. **Case construction** - Creating the hinged wrapper
5. **Assembly** - Joining trays to case
6. **Finishing** - Final details and cure

Each step builds on previous work. Mistakes early compound later.

### When to Use Clamshell Boxes

**Ideal for:**
- Valuable books
- Fragile items
- Long-term storage
- Display and presentation
- Archival purposes

**Overkill for:**
- Books in active use (use slipcase)
- Temporary storage
- Books without special value

### Conclusion

A well-made clamshell box represents the pinnacle of book protection. The combination of custom-fit trays and hinged case creates an enclosure that preserves contents indefinitely while presenting beautifully.

The skills developed in this project - precision measurement, box construction, covering, and assembly - transfer to many other bookbinding enclosure projects. Master the clamshell, and simpler boxes become easy.

Your finished box protects while it impresses. The time invested in careful construction produces an object worthy of the treasures it holds.
