# Quarter-Leather Binding

Quarter-leather binding is a classic style where the spine is covered in leather, while the sides are covered in cloth or decorative paper. This style offers the durability and elegance of leather at the hinge—the part of the book that flexes most—without the expense and difficulty of a full leather cover.

### Why Choose Quarter-Leather?

*   **Durability:** Leather provides superior strength at the joint compared to cloth or paper.
*   **Aesthetics:** The contrast between the leather spine and marbled paper sides is historically significant and visually striking.
*   **Cost:** It uses significantly less skin than a full binding.

### Key Techniques

#### 1. Leather Paring (The Hinge)
As discussed in our *Knife Sharpening Workshop*, the leather must be pared thin where it turns in at the head and tail, but also along the "joint" where the board opens.
*   **Spine Area:** Leave full thickness (or slightly thinned) for strength.
*   **Joint Area:** Pare to approximately 0.5-0.7mm to ensure the board opens freely.
*   **Turn-ins:** Pare to 0.3mm to avoid bulk at the headcaps.

#### 2. Board Attachment
Unlike case binding, quarter-leather bindings often use a "Split Board" or "Laced-on" structure where the boards are attached to the text block *before* covering.
*   **Split Boards:** A thick board and a thin board glued together, with a pocket left for the sewing tapes or waste sheet to be inserted.

#### 3. Covering the Spine
1.  **Paste Up:** Apply wheat starch paste to the leather. Let it soak to relax the fibers.
2.  **Mounting:** Center the leather on the spine.
3.  **Molding:** Use a bone folder to mold the leather over the spine bands (if present) and into the joints.
4.  **Tying Up:** Wrap cord around the book and over the joints to hold the leather tight while it dries.

#### 4. Siding Up
Once the leather is dry and trimmed, the paper or cloth sides are applied.
*   **Trim:** Cut the paper to overlap the leather by exactly 3-4mm.
*   **Glue:** Use PVA or a mix of PVA/Paste for the sides.
*   **Rub Down:** Ensure neat adhesion where the paper overlaps the leather.

### Troubleshooting
*   **Stiff Opening:** Usually caused by leather that wasn't pared thin enough at the hinge.
*   **Staining:** Paste can stain some leathers. Keep your hands and tools clean.

Mastering the quarter-binding teaches you the fundamental handling of leather before you move on to full-skin covers.
